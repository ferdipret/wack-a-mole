# Wack-a-mole

## Made with [React](https://reactjs.org) & [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)

## [Demo](https://frozen-shelf-65214.herokuapp.com/)

### Assumptions

- Since it's impossible the hit moles simultaneously on desktop,
  moles will pop up 4 at a time and the score is calculated based on how many of
  4 moles you hit.

- For best effect, all moles appear at the same time, and there is a 30% chance
  that one of the 4 would be a bomb.

- This means that the score is calculated when either;

  1.  All of the moles are wacked.
  2.  The moles go back in their holes.
  3.  You hit a bomb and the score is calculated before the game ends.

## Enjoy!
